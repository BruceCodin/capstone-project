# Capstone Project: Hangman Game
## Hangman Game Summary 
Hangman is a word-guessing game where one player tries to guess a secret word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure drawing of a hanged man is added. The guesser wins if they guess the word correctly before the drawing is complete. 
## About Project
This project emulates the hangman game using python programming and the command terminal used as a visual display.
A secret word is pre-set which the user is required to guess letter by letter. 

* The user is notified whether they're letter guess is successful or not 
* If letter guess is incorrect, a hangman is drawn each subsequent time nearing completion
* The game finishes once either the word is guessed correctly within 7 letters or the user fails the 7 attempts and the hangman is drawn
